  <p>
    I'm trying to get <a href='http://foss.rit.edu/blog/decause'>Remy Decausemaker</a>
    to quit smoking. My previous efforts at getting him to stop have failed to
    have the desired effects. This time I'm making it a bit more public...
    making his progress publically available and critiquable.
