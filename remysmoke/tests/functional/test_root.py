"""
Functional test suite for the root controller.

This is an example of how functional tests can be written for controllers.

As opposed to a unit-test, which test a small unit of functionality,
functional tests exercise the whole application and its WSGI stack.

Please read http://pythonpaste.org/webtest/ for more information.
